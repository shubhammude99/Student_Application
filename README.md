# Student_Application
The code has 3 classes: `Student` (for student details), `StudentApplication` (menu-driven interface), and `StudentDriver` (operations handler). It allows adding, removing, displaying, and searching student records. The `Student` class holds student data, `StudentApplication` manages user interactions, and `StudentDriver` implements operations.
